# Celebal Summer Internship — Data Engineer 2025 🌐

Welcome to my internship repository for the **Celebal Summer Internship Program - Data Engineering (2025)**. This repo contains **weekly assignments** and real-world **data engineering projects** I worked on during my internship at **Celebal Technologies**. Each week's folder documents a new challenge, tool, or concept — ranging from SQL and ADF to SFTP, Blob Storage, and incremental data pipelines.



## 📁 Directory Structure

| Week | Topic Highlights |

| [Week 5 Assignment](./week5assignment/week5.md)
| [Week 6 Assignment](./week6assignment/week6.md) | SFTP + ADF + Azure SQL/Blob + Incremental Load + Trigger |



## 🚀 Latest Highlight: Week 6 — ADF End-to-End ETL with Trigger

✅ Built 2 separate pipelines:
- Extracts data from **on-prem SQL Server to Azure SQL Database**
- Loads year-wise CSV files from **SFTP server to Azure Data Lake Storage**

✅ Implemented:
- Watermark-based **incremental load logic**
- A **master pipeline** to run both child pipelines
- **Trigger setup** to schedule runs every **last Saturday of the month**
